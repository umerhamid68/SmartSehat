            "Traditional Pakistani Roast Chicken is made without skin on the chicken. If you source your chicken from a Pakistani butcher they will skin it for you. If not, follow the instructions in the video below!",
            "To insure that the chicken is juice and flavored really well on the inside I like to inject it with a spicy liquid marinade as well as massaging the outside with a prepped mixture.",
            "Melt the butter, squeeze the lemon juice and then mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl.",
            "Using a poultry injection syringe, work your way around the chicken and inject the liquid just under the skin (see notes)",
            "The rule is to inject 1 oz of liquid per pound of meat. Too much, and it will start oozing out. Of course, there will be some leakage, as the video below reflects. Just massage this into the surface of the chicken.",
            "The most important step is to make sure the chicken is well salted, so rub the salt and massage it in well into the skin. I find 1/2 teaspoon a pound of chicken sufficient as the broth I use has some salt in it too. Feel free to adjust if necessary.",
            "Next I grind my ginger, garlic and serrano peppers in my mortar and pestle and rub them all over the chicken to flavor it.",
            "The last step is to use the crushed red chili pepper flakes for some spice and the smoked paprika for some added flavor and color (see notes)",
            "Heat the cooking oil.",
            "Sear the meat lightly on all four sides on full heat.",
            "Add 4 cups of water, cover the pot tightly, lower the heat to medium-low, and let the steam cook the meat.",
            "Once the meat is cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, dry out the liquid to a thick gravy and pour it over the roast just before serving."
        ],
        "notes": [
            "Chicken - Pakistanis generally don't eat chicken with skin on. Our traditional butchers sell both whole and cut-up chicken with the skin off. However, living here in the USA, I have often had to take care of this part myself. The video below will help guide you through the process. I recommend a whole skinless chicken, preferably 2-3 pounds, and never larger than 4 lbs for this recipe. If you prefer, you can also use leg quarters and thighs. But you must reduce cooking times by 10-15 minutes if you opt for this.",
            "Ginger, Garlic, Serrano peppers - I like to use a mortar and pestle to grind these three together and make a fragrant paste that I apply to the chicken. I massage it in well on the surface and inside the cavity. This mixture adds flavor and is a great way to kill any odor of raw meat!",
            "Smoked Paprika - I use smoked paprika instead of Kashmiri red chilies, which are the more traditional option. I do this because paprika is easier to source, and I like its smoky taste and the color it adds to the meat.",
            "Injecting the Marinade - When injecting the chicken, place your syringe just inside the surface of the top layer of skin and start pushing the liquid in. Don't inject more than 1 ounce in one particular location. Keep a paper towel handy, as some liquid is likely to ooze out as you remove the syringe. Move around the chicken, from breast to leg to thigh to wing, to evenly distribute the marinade. If too much starts to ooze out, it's usually a sign that you must stop.",

Move around the chicken, from breast to leg to thigh to wing,",
            "Cooking the Chicken-If the chicken is very tender and cooked to 165 degrees, it may be a good idea to remove it from the cooking pot while you dry out the liquid. This prevents the chicken from falling apart. When you plate the chicken, just pour the cooked liquid over it to coat the meat."

            "Cornish Hens-Since these are smaller than a 4 lb chicken, they cook in half the time it takes to roast an entire chicken. There is no need for the injected marinade. Instead, mix the lemon and dry spice powders with the marinade you will apply to the surface of the chicken. Omit the butter, vinegar, and chicken broth completely. I like to skin my Cornish hens to get that authentic steam roast taste.",
            "Turkey-For Turkey, leave the skin on and roast it in the oven instead of steaming it. Apply the marinade as instructed, both the injection and the surface marinade. Add a little butter to the surface mixture, about one tablespoon per pound of meat, to help crisp up the skin. For baking times, I would bake Turkey in a preheated oven at 350 degrees, 13 minutes per pound of turkey.",
            "Change up the injection-Try a BBQ version of the roast chicken by injecting rice vinegar, soy sauce, garlic powder, brown sugar, and sriracha, or a Cajun version uses a pre-mixed Cajun spice blend with apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper."

        "expert_tips": [
            "Source the proper chicken - To ensure a juicy roast chicken, try to get a chicken that weighs about 2-3 pounds. The larger the chicken, the tougher the meat. At most, the chicken should be 4 pounds.",
            "Use a thermometer - To ensure the chicken cooks through, use your thermometer to check various points in the chicken. Get readings from the thigh, wing, and breast for complete accuracy.",
            "Cooking time - For the perfect juicy roast chicken, remember to calculate cooking times based on the size of the bird. The average is 11-18 minutes per pound of meat. On my gas stove and in my particular pot, which is wide with a heavy base, I average about 11.5 minutes per pound."

            "Yogurt - I always recommend using full fat plain yogurt. This makes the curry creamier. Greek yogurt tends to curdle when cooked and low fat yogurt can be too watery. Remember to add in the yogurt a little at a time to let it adjust to the temperature. If all the yogurt is added at once to the hot mixture in the pot, it curdles immediately.",

            "Spinach - My go to is frozen chopped spinach. I don't personally like the taste and texture of baby spinach in my curries and it's more expensive than the frozen option. Fresh spinach takes a long time to prep and adds on a good 20 minutes to the cooking time. You can go with whatever option you prefer; the conversion will be 1.25 pounds of raw spinach per 12 ounces of frozen spinach.",
            "Potatoes - Waxy potatoes, like red or golden are the best options for this curry. This is because they hold their shape well and withstand the stirring and roasting that a curry requires."

Steam your spinach (whichever type you're using) and then run it through a food processor to make a spinach paste (it will absorb more flavor quicker this way).",

        "expert_tips": [
            "Baby Spinach - Baby Spinach is great for salads and sandwiches due to its crisp, mild almost sweet taste. But in the case of curries, it doesn't hold up too well. Due to its delicate texture, it tends to get a little slimy when cooked. This added to the fact that it's more expensive made it a non-option for me.",
            "Regular Fresh Spinach - Regular spinach is a cheaper option and its earthier and bolder taste is more suited to curries and cooked dishes. However, I would need a pound of fresh spinach for this recipe. The amount of time it would take to prep and clean that much spinach is tedious. Plus, the quality would have to be super fresh and well-sourced. This led me to the last and final option.",
            "Frozen Spinach - Frozen spinach is affordable, it has the perfect taste for curries and is already prepped for use! In addition to this, vegetables picked to be frozen are usually harvested at peak ripeness. This makes them nutritionally dense! All wins in my book!"

            "Eggplants - For best results, use baby eggplants. If you can't access them, the next best variety to use is the long thin variety available at Asian markets. If all else fails, just cut a regular large eggplant into small pieces and fry them until the skin softens and the white flesh turns brown. The skin on the smaller eggplants softens very easily, but the larger varieties have thicker skin so that you may get different results. Steam them for longer at the later stage rather than overfrying them.",
            "Cooking Oil - I use Canola oil due to its high heat index and affordable price. Other options are Peanut oil, sunflower oil, and avocado oil.",
            "Tamarind Water - I make my tamarind water by soaking some tamarind pulp. If you want a shortcut, substitute with ready-made tamarind paste or concentrate.",
            "Onion - Browning the onions is the most important part of any curry. They must be a medium golden brown for the caramelized taste, color, and texture in the curry to be perfect. As a substitute, if you're short on time, you can use pre-fried crispy onions. Use three tablespoons in place of 1 medium onion.",
            "Adding In Water - The desiccated coconut and ground nuts are dry, absorbing much water. The three cups mentioned above may need to be adjusted as you cook the curry. I like my curry on the thicker side, but if you like yours to be thinner, then feel free to adjust the water accordingly.",
            "Desiccated Coconut - The traditional curry is made with fresh coconut, but I find sourcing and using desiccated coconut much easier for this recipe.",
            "Raw unsalted peanuts - Peanuts without skin are preferred, but if you can't source those, leave the skin on.",
            "Adjust Spices - This curry is not usually very spicy, instead relying on its taste from the coconut, nuts, tamarind, and other aromatic spices. Adjust the red chili powder according to taste if you prefer your curry spicier."

            "Use hot water - I keep some hot water on hand to add to the bagara baingan curry as needed. Adding room-temperature water stops the cooking process and adds to your cooking time.",

Prep and store the dry powdered mix in the fridge, in an airtight container, a week in advance and fry the eggplants a day ahead. Once all the Hyderabadi bagara baingan curry components are ready, the final steps will take very little time."

Some people are more sensitive to this than others. If it's not a problem for you and you're in a hurry, you can skip this step. The soaking can also help reduce the cooking time, so if you decide not to opt for this method, you may need to cook your lentils for about 10 minutes longer.",

Always start with a higher water content ingredient, as it will take longer to temper. Garlic - Add the garlic first, as it will take slightly longer than the cumin due to moisture that needs to evaporate. As soon as it's light brown, add in the next ingredient. Cumin - Don't roast the cumin for more than 30 seconds because it will continue to cook with the other ingredients, and any longer than 30 seconds can cause it to burn and taste bitter. Dry Red Chilies - Once you add the dry chilies, it barely takes a few seconds before they turn brown. Immediately turn the stove off at this point to prevent them from burning, and pour all the ingredients on the cooked lentils. Curry Leaves - If you're using these add them in last. They only need to cook for 10-15 seconds."

            "Cardamom - Break open the cardamom pods, remove the seeds, crush and use. You can substitute with 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder if you wish but I recommend using actual cardamom seeds for best flavor.",

            "Edible Silver/Gold Leaf - Sweet shops in Pakistan apply silver leaf to their 'mithai' to decorate it, especially during Eid and for weddings. This is optional but once again adds a beautiful and festive touch.",
            "Adding In The Milk Powder - The milk powder needs to be added slowly and whisked constantly to prevent clumps from forming. The mixture will be grainy due to the proportion of liquids to solids but undissolved clumps in the barfi will obviously taste unpleasant and need to be smoothed out.",
            "When Is Your Mixture Done - Some recipes call for and show a fairly well formed dough like mixture by the end of the stirring process. I find that stopping just short of that point makes for a softer texture for the barfi. Since the mixture has been cooking for so long, it keeps evaporating and thickening even after the heat is turned off. I usually stir an extra minute or two after the mixture leaves the sides of the pan and then turn the heat off. I leave the mixture in the pan and grease and line my baking pan. In that time, the mixture thickens a bit more and by the time I'm done transferring it and spreading it in the pan it firms up some more, reaching the perfect consistency."

            "Meat - Using the right meat is critical to making the kebab turn out well. The recipe requires the use of Beef tenderloin. This is then cut into thin strips and pounded using a meat tenderizer until they are paper thin (called 'parchas').",
            "Onion - The onion must be chopped, browned in 1/4 cup of oil, and then ground to a paste, with the oil included, to be used in the marinade. If you prefer to use store-bought brown onions, then use \u215b cup and add a teaspoon of oil to moisten them.",
            "Kiwi - Traditionally, raw papaya is used as a tenderizer in the Bihari kabab recipe. At most, one tablespoon per pound of meat should be used. Too much can cause the meat to shred and also taste bitter. Without availability, Kiwi works amazingly well as a substitute and is my go-to here in the USA. Use 1/2 a kiwi per pound of meat. A powdered meat tenderizer is also an option, but I'm not a massive fan as I've always found that it alters the taste of the kebab and leaves the texture short of being authentic. If that is your only option, use about one tablespoon per pound.",
            "Gram Flour - Gram flour, or Chickpea flour, is made from specific South Asian Chickpeas. This recipe adds a pleasant nutty taste and helps act as a binding agent, making the ground spices stick to the meat and not fall off during marination and cooking.",
            "Marinade Time - Many recipes offer a variety of suggestions for marination time. After much experimentation, if you use beef tenderloin cut in thin strips as recommended in this recipe and a kiwi, overnight marination is necessary to get the right texture for this kebab. However, ensure you stay within 12 hours, or the meat will start tearing and shredding as you thread it on the skewers.",
            "Grilling the Kabab - If you want to cook the bihari kabab on an outdoor grill, preheat the grill to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and cook for 20-25 minutes. Flip every 5 minutes to get an even char on both sides and cover the grill for 10-15 minutes to ensure the kababs are cooked in the middle. Check the internal temperature and cook to 160 degrees Fahrenheit, the kabab taste best when well done."

            "Cilantro - Fresh cilantro with thin stems is the crucial ingredient in this raita recipe. Discard any thick stems, as they will make the raita runny. However, the thin stems carry a lot of flavor and aroma, so I like to use them. Onion - I use a quarter of a yellow onion to add bulk and flavor to this recipe.  Please don't use too much, as it will alter the taste. Yellow onion is preferred, but if needed, you can substitute this with a red onion. Serrano - If you find this too spicy, de-seed it or use a jalapeno instead. Ginger - Use 1 teaspoon of crushed ginger paste or freshly zested ginger. Lemon - This adds flavor, keeps the herbs vibrant green, and provides a liquid base to the chutney. The spices - The salt, cumin, and amchur are a must, but I also like adding red chili powder. This adds a different heat than the pepper, and the 2 combine for perfect flavor. Water - Use water only if necessary. I keep this on hand and add only 1 tablespoon at a time. Yogurt - The final ingredient, this takes a simple chutney and turns it into raita. Milk-I use milk when the yogurt is too thick or sour. It helps create a perfect consistency and flavor. Freezing the chutney- I like to batch-make at least 1 cup of green chutney at a time and freeze it in an ice tray in 2-tablespoon portions. This way, I can quickly defrost a cube of the chutney and add it to my yogurt."

However, gram flour is made from split chickpeas, known as yellow gram lentils, and not garbanzo beans. For best results, source gram flour through a South Asian grocery store or Amazon.",
            "Tomatoes - I use Roma tomatoes for this curry. If you don't have fresh tomatoes or want added convenience, add a 1/3 cup of crushed canned tomatoes. The canned tomatoes give the curry a smoother consistency, which you may prefer.",
            "Egg Noodles - I use wide egg noodles that come in a 1 lb bag. Depending on the noodles-to-curry ratio you like and how many people you're feeding, you may want to make more than one packet.",
            "Crispy Noodles - Traditionally, noodles were fried till crispy and then used as a topping, but fortunately, there are easy alternatives nowadays. I use store-bought La Choy crunchy noodles, easily available at all supermarkets in the Asian or International foods aisle.",
            "Roasting The Gram Flour - This part is essential as you want the gram flour to taste nutty. Without roasting it, besan can have a raw taste. However, you will notice that since the flour absorbs all the oil and liquid, it will start sticking to the bottom of the pan.",
            "I usually keep a cup of water nearby and splash as necessary to prevent the flour from burning. This part is tricky because you don't want to add too much water to get a good roast, but you don't want the flour to taste burnt or stick to the pan.",
            "Water - At this point, the mixture will look like a butter chicken curry. The consistency will change after it simmers for a while and you add the water and coconut milk."

            "Chicken - Chicken karahi tastes best if made with bone-in chicken cut into small pieces. If you're sourcing the chicken from a South Asian butcher, ask for a karahi cut. If that isn't an option, use this guide for assistance.",
            "Ghee - It's best to use ghee for an authentic taste. If you can't source ghee, butter is a good substitute. If you using so much ghee or butter unhealthy, I suggest using 1/2 oil and 1/2 ghee or butter.",
            "Onions - Traditionally, chicken karahi doesn't have onions. Still, based on customer feedback and recipe testing, I added them to this recipe to add more gravy to dip the naan in. Feel free to omit them if you don't like them in your karahi.",
            "Garlic paste - For this recipe, try to use a homemade paste. For a small batch, you'll need 20 garlic cloves, a garlic press, a mortar, and a pestle. I buy a large bag of peeled garlic cloves, run them through my food processor, and freeze the batch to use over a few weeks.",
            "Tomato paste - This is an ingredient I started adding to my karahi a while back, and I find the two tablespoons add a lot of flavor to the chicken.",
            "Coriander and cumin seeds - This is the only part of the spice blend that you'll have to spend time preparing. Roast the seeds in a nonstick frying pan for 30 seconds to release their aroma. Grind them coarsely in a mortar and pestle and add them to the curry.",
            "Fenugreek leaves - Make sure to use the dried leaves and not seeds, as the former can taste bitter in this recipe. While the herb tastes delicious in the karahi, feel free to omit it if you have trouble sourcing it.",
            "Green chilies - I slice the green chilies lengthwise and add them if it's just my family. You can deseed the chilies if you want the curry to be less spicy. I add the chilies whole when I cook the karahi for a large group. This way, those who want to eat them can pick them out, but because they haven't been cut open, they don't make the curry too spicy for everyone.",
            "Ginger - I love ginger, and this recipe is supposed to have a lot of it, so I've recommended a large amount in the recipe. Feel free to cut back on the amount if you find this too much or if it's a taste you're unfamiliar with.",
            "Cooking the chicken - When adding the chicken to the hot oil, add a few pieces at a time; wait for the oil temperature to rise, and then add a few more until all of the chicken is in the karahi. If all the chicken is added at once, the oil will cool down too much, and the chicken will start to release water. This will affect the final result of the recipe.",
            "Similarly, in the end, when it's time to add the green chilies and ginger, if the chicken is cooked and there is still too much liquid in the karahi, remove the meat with a slotted spoon and set it aside. Cook the remaining ingredients till the liquid evaporates, add the chicken back, finish, and serve."

            "Use ghee - For the best flavor, use ghee. If this is difficult to source, butter is a good substitute. A combination of half oil and half ghee or butter also works if you want the flavor but are also concerned about health.",
            "Use bone-in small-cut chicken - Using bone-in chicken cut properly is key. Either find a butcher who can do this for you or use a pair of kitchen shears and this guide to help you.",
            "Use a karahi, wok, or a wide skillet - Not everyone has a karahi to cook at home. But make sure to use a wide pan with raised sides to move the chicken around and saute it well.",
            "Use a homemade spice blend - Take an extra minute to bloom and grind your spices versus a store-bought blend. The result in flavor will be well worth the effort.",
            "Have everything prepped - This recipe takes just 30 minutes to cook from start to finish. With so much chopping and cutting, it's best to have everything prepped before you start cooking. This will ensure perfect results."

I've also tested with khus khus (white poppy seeds) and bread crumbs and found that bread is the most convenient and yields the best results.",
            "Make a test meatball - Before cooking the entire batch of koftas, I always cook a tiny one in my microwave to taste the seasoning and texture. This allows me to adjust anything I need before making the entire batch.",
            "Baking is the best -  I've tested cooking my koftas using various methods and find that baking takes the least effort. Baking also caramelizes the surface of the koftas just like the fried ones, giving them a more authentic flavor and texture."

            "Long Pepper -  Also known as Piper Longum and Pippali, is an Indian Long Pepper that is the primary ingredient in Nihari. You just won't get that authentic taste without it in the mix so I highly recommend sourcing it from Amazon and using it. Beef Shank - The best meat to use for the Nihari is bone-in Beef Shank. Make sure to buy and use marrow bones as well. This is what really gives the stew its rich flavor and a special trip to the butcher will be well worth your effort. The flour - Use Durum wheat flour, known as \"Atta\" for this recipe. This is wholemeal wheat flour and has a distinctly nutty taste. The recipe will be better with this, but if you can't source it then use regular wheat flour. Serrano Chilies - The closest to the Pakistani chilies I grew up eating, these are my go-to when cooking all of my curries. I find that other chili varieties just don't give that authenticity of flavor to my food. If you find them too spicy, you can deseed them. Spice grinder - I use a coffee grinder as my spice grinder and find that it grinds all my spices quickly and efficiently. Preparing the slurry - Make sure to prepare the flour slurry with hot water to prevent the flour from clumping."

            "Chicken - I use chicken tenderloins for all of my boneless chicken recipes. I find the thighs too fatty, and the tenderloin is the juiciest part of the breast. The result is juicy and succulent tandoori chicken.",
            "Yogurt - Full-fat yogurt is necessary in this recipe as the fat helps keep the chicken moist. If you use low-fat yogurt, I suggest adding a tablespoon of cooking oil or ghee per pound of chicken to keep the moisture intact.",
            "Ginger & Garlic Paste - I make a homemade paste and freeze it, preferring the taste to the store-bought version. I recommend doing this for better flavor, but it's not essential.",
            "Beetroot powder - This is an optional ingredient I prefer to red food color. You can ignore it, use it like I've suggested, or use a larger quantity for a restaurant-type presentation.",
            "Alternate cooking methods - The grill pan method is my preferred way to cook my tandoori chicken, but you're welcome to use one of the following options if you prefer: Outdoor Grill - Preheat the grill to 450 degrees, brush the chicken with oil, and cook for 7-10 minutes on each side. Use a meat thermometer to check that the chicken is done. An ideal reading for poultry is 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Oven - Preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and place the chicken in a roasting pan with a rack. Bake for 15 minutes and then broil for 5 minutes on high for a charred look. Check the internal temperature of the meat and ensure it's cooked to 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Air fryer - Preheat your air fryer to 350 degrees and cook the chicken for 4-5 minutes on each side. Check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer to be sure the chicken is cooked to 165 degrees Fahrenheit."

            "Add in the tamarind last - In my experience, adding anything acidic at the end of preparing a curry preserves its sour flavor better. If cooked for a while, citrus or tamarind can lose some of its pungent flavor. In the case of tamarind, some natural sugars can also burn if overcooked.",
            "Soak the lentils - Soaking the lentils isn't essential, but helps reduce gas and bloating that's associated with them. It also helps to reduce the cooking time.",
            "Use an immersion blender if needed - Red lentils cook down very easily so I've seldom needed to blend them. If you feel the need or are using a different lentil in this recipe, use an immersion blender to speed up the process and get a perfect consistency.",

Process for 2-3 minutes until smooth. The batter should be thick and smooth, thicker than pancake batter.",
            "Whisk Batter: Transfer to a bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Add cumin seeds and baking powder. Whisk vigorously for 1 minute to aerate. Alternately, use a stand mixer with a whisk attachment for 1 minute. Test if a drop of batter floats on top of water.",

(See Note 4 on how to freeze.)",

            "Note 4: To Make-Ahead and Refrigerate or Freeze - Once you've fried the bhallas, allow them to cool. Place in an airtight container or zip-top bag. Store in the fridge 3-4 days or freezer for up to 3 months. From frozen: When ready to use, transfer to a bowl of hot water. Allow to soak for 40 minutes. From refrigerator: Proceed to soak in water as directed in recipe. Squeeze out water as directed before proceeding with the recipe."

            "Place the potatoes in a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high power for 5 minutes. If your potatoes are small, they may be fork tender already. If not, use a tong to turn the potatoes over and continue to cook in 2-minute increments until fork tender. To test doneness: Cut in half to see if the potatoes have cooked fully on the inside. The knife should slide through without resistance. If not, microwave in 1 minute bursts just until fully cooked.",
            "Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel and transfer to a medium bowl. Use a potato masher to mash them until no large lumps remain.",
            "To Prepare Aloo Tikki",
            "Place the remaining Aloo Tikki ingredients in a food processor (Note 1). Use the pulse function to chop so that the onions are finely chopped but not blended (~20 pulses). You don't want the onions to break down too much and end up releasing water. If you do notice any excess water in the mixture, tilt the food processor to drain it or dab it with a paper towel.",
            "Add the chopped onion mixture to the mashed potatoes and mix to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding salt to taste, red chili flakes/powder for more heat, and chaat masala/amchur/lemon juice for more tang. Keep in mind the flavors will mellow out once you fry them. Ideally, allow this mixture to rest, covered, in the refrigerator for 20 minutes (though I often skip this step).",
            "Using your hands, shape 1/4 cup of the mixture into a round, 1/2\" thick patty about 2 ½-3 inches in diameter. If you find that the Tikkis are too soft or not holding their shape, mix in 1-2 tbsp breadcrumbs. Continue with the rest of the mixture. You'll have around 12 patties.",
            "Place the egg and breadcrumbs (if using) in shallow bowls so that you can dip them as you cook.",
            "Heat a large nonstick skillet, frying pan, or cast iron pan over medium heat. Add oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan.",
            "Dip both sides of each patty into the egg wash, and then the breadcrumbs (if using). Place 4-5 patties in the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, using a spatula to turn them over while using another spatula to hold them in place. Reduce heat if the patties are cooking too fast. Tip: To cook the edges/outer rim of the Tikkis evenly, move them to the corners of the pan where there's more oil.",
            "Transfer the patties onto a paper towel lined plate. Repeat until you have finished pan-frying all the patties. Cook any leftover egg in the remaining oil and serve with the patties. Serve with green chutney or tamarind chutney (quick recipes in post), mint raita, or your favorite sauce."

            "Note 1: If you don’t have a food processor, finely chop the onion, green chili peppers, cilantro, and mint. Mix with the remaining ingredients (excluding the egg) in a bowl.",
            "Note 2: Update June 2024 –  The original recipe used a bit of whisked egg in the mixture, which adds flavor and fluffy, silky texture. But I’ve found using it makes the mixture loose, which makes it hard for the Tikkis to hold shape. This requires breadcrumbs which in turn dilutes the flavor. I’ve therefore updated the recipe to omit the egg in the mixture altogether. If you still want to add it, use 2 tbsp of the whisked egg. Use the remaining to pan-fry the eggs.",

I don't recommend anything bigger than a 2 lb chicken as the smaller chickens are juicier and more succulent. They are also quicker and easier to cook. I prefer the chicken skinless for this steamed version of the Sajji as the skin only tastes good if it's crispy. Going skinless also helps reduce the fat content and calories of the meal , which for me is a plus factor.",

            "Brining The Chicken - Brining, or soaking the chicken in salt and vinegar water makes the chicken juicier and more flavorful. An hour per lb of chicken is enough as too long in a brining solution can actually make the chicken mushy.",
            "Sauteing The Chicken - This step is essential as it helps seal in the chicken's juices and also gives the roast a nice caramelized color.",
            "Finishing The Chicken - I usually like to finish the chicken with a second saute or sear at the end. If the chicken seems cooked I remove it from the water and dry the liquid separately. This prevents the meat from overcooking and drying out. As the liquid evaporates and all I can see is the residual oil and fat, I add the meat back to the pot and brown a bit more on all sides."

If it's added all at once, even at room temperature,  it cools the temperature of all the other ingredients and stops the cooking process. The result is a curdled gravy texture.",

            "Room Temperature Ingredients - Having your ingredients, especially the butter, at room temperature produces a lighter, fluffier cake.",
            "Baking Tins - Although most recipes give options for different types of baking tins, in this particular cake I would suggest sticking to nonstick. This cake is very light and delicate and even with the use of nonstick spray and parchment paper, taking it out of the baking tin can cause breakage. The nonstick pans make the process much smoother.",
            "Creaming the Butter and Sugar - Creaming the butter and sugar for 1-2 minutes is an important part of the baking process. This is what traps the air in the butter. As the cake bakes, this air expands and makes the cake soft and fluffy.",
            "Alternating Dry and wet Ingredients - Alternating the ingredients ensures a smoother batter in less time. This means that less gluten will be released as the flour will not be over beaten. The result is a less dense cake.",
            "Testing The Cake - I have and use a cake tester to check and see if my cake is done, but a toothpick works just as well. Another method is to lightly touch the center of the cake and see if it springs back. If your finger leaves a slight impression, the cake needs a little more time. The last great method is to use a cooking thermometer to check for doneness. The perfect internal temperature you're looking for is 210 degrees.",
            "The Icing - The icing comes together easily. The heavy whipping cream gives it a light airy texture so it doesn't taste too buttery and the salt prevents it from tasting too sweet. Paired with the coffee it's the perfect taste and texture.",
            "The Almonds - The traditional British version of this coffee cake usually has walnuts, but I decided to go with the more popular Pakistani almonds. They need to be chopped and pressed into the sides of the cake but since you want to taste the bits, a hand held chopper works best. If you don't have one, place the nuts in a ziploc bag and use a rolling pin to crush them to the size required."

            "Shrimp - I usually buy 1 pound of peeled and deveined jumbo shrimp. This means about 25-30 shrimp total and 6-7 shrimp per person. The marinade is calculated based on this quantity, so if you cook a larger quantity, adjust the marinade accordingly.",
            "Cooking oil - My preferred cooking oil is avocado, but canola, sunflower, or peanut oil all have a high heat index and are good substitutes.",
            "Marinating the shrimp - Too long of a marination can par-cook any seafood, making it tough and chewy once cooked. Ideally, marinate the prawns for 30 minutes and no longer than 1 hour.",

            "Add garam masala - Most tandoori spice blends have garam masala in them. I don't use any in this recipe, as it would overpower the shrimp with a mild, sweet, buttery flavor. However, add 1/4 teaspoon per pound of shrimp for a slightly different flavor if you'd like.",
            "Add food coloring - If your familiarity with South Asian food is based on a restaurant experience, you'll question why these tandoori prawns (amongst other authentic tandoori recipes) aren't a vibrant red. The only way to get that color without adding a large amount of chilies is a few drops of food coloring or beetroot powder.",
            "Use a ready-made tandoori spice blend - You can source and use many ready-made tandoori spice blends on the market. If you haven't already, download my spice guide and check out the brands I love and use regularly.",
            "Cook a tandoori fish tikka instead - This marinade works great with any seafood. Choose a meaty fish like mahi mahi, salmon, or barramundi, to name a few. Cut it into large cubes, about 2\" in size, marinate, place on bamboo skewers, and cook using your preferred method.",
            "Opt for an alternative cooking method - Place the marinated shrimp on skewers and cook them on an outdoor gas grill at 400 degrees Fahrenheit; broil them on a baking sheet on medium-high heat in your oven or air-fry them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side for all the methods until the prawns become opaque. Serve with naan bread, lime wedges, and your favorite chutney."

        "expert_tips": [
            "Pat the shrimp dry - Make sure to pat the shrimp dry before adding them to the marinade. This helps the marinade stick to them and creates a nice crust as they cook.",
            "Don't marinate longer than 1 hour - Beyond an hour, the acid from the lemons in the tandoori marinade can start cooking the prawns, which results in chewy shrimp.",
            "Use flat skewers - Try to source flat skewers as they help keep the shrimp secure. If you're using wooden skewers, soak them overnight so they don't burn on the grill.",
            "Don't overcook your seafood - Seafood cooks in a very short amount of time and can get tough and stringy if it's overcooked. Fish takes about 8-10 minutes, and shrimp take 3-5 minutes. Remember that all meat keeps cooking for up to a few minutes after you take it off the grill, so as soon as the shrimp turns opaque, remove it from its source of heat.",
            "Add some oil to the marinade - Adding 1/4 cup of a high heat index oil, like avocado or canola, to the marinade helps make the shrimp more juicy and succulent."

Add the black-eyed beans, seal and set the IP to 5 minutes on high pressure, and do a natural release.

I'm not a fan of the canned variety for two reasons. They contain preservatives which I like to avoid when possible, and they're fully cooked. This can make the bean curry mushy and also leave it tasting bland. Since the black-eyed peas don't have time to absorb all the flavors of the spices, aromatics, and onion tomato gravy, the flavor of all these doesn't really come through.",
            "Soak your dry beans - If you use dry black-eyed peas, soak them. A long overnight soak is best, but if you don't have enough time, a short soak in hot water for 2-4 hours will help shorten the cooking time. Soaking helps reduce flatulence when eating beans and lentils and shortens cooking time.",
            "Mash some of the beans - If you want to thicken your curry, take a spoon or two of the cooked lobia and mash them up. This will release the starch and thicken the curry without waiting for the water to evaporate."

            "Chicken - Chicken tenderloins are my go-to for all my boneless chicken recipes. Much juicier than the breast and less fatty than the thighs, they work perfectly in this recipe. Authentic Hyderabadi chicken curry is made with bone-in chicken. While that adds to the flavor, it takes longer to cook. I use this quick version for a weeknight option and the more complex version for special occasions. You pick which one you want to cook.",
            "Peanuts - Traditionally, most South Asian curries are made with raw peanuts that have the skin removed. However, if all I can source are the ones with the skin on, I roast and grind them as is.",
            "Coconut - Desiccated coconut is not the same as shredded coconut. It is unsweetened and has had all the moisture stripped from it. You can identify it by its consistency, which is that of a powder.",
            "Oil - I use a high heat index oil such as avocado, canola, sunflower, or peanut. The amount of oil I use in this curry is slightly more than in my other recipes. This is because boneless chicken is lean and releases little natural oil. In addition, the ground peanuts and coconut are very dry and absorb oil easily. Any less than 1/3 of a cup will result in a very dry curry.",
            "Onions - Two medium onions are equal to 2 cups of diced onions. If you're using pre-fried store-bought onions, use 1/4 cup for each cup of fresh chopped onions.",
            "The chilies - Serrano chilies work best with Pakistani food. If you find them too spicy, half them and remove the seeds.",
            "The tamarind - I use so much tamarind in my cooking that I make my own tamarind water. If you want an easier route, buy tamarind concentrate or puree and mix 2.5 tablespoons with 1/2 cup of water to make the water."

This helps reduce any gamey smell the meat may have, breaks down all the ingredients for a well-blended curry, and adds a beautiful color to the curry."

            "Cooking Oil - Samosas are traditionally deep fried and as such require a huge amount of cooking oil, depending on how many you are frying. There are healthier alternatives and details for those have been provided in this blog post above.",
            "Stove Top Method For Filling - To cook the Tikka Masala on the Stove use a heavy bottomed pan and saute the meat using 2 tablespoons of cooking oil, as you did in the Instant Pot. Once the meat is well seared, add about 4 cups of water, cover and bring the mixture to a boil on high. Then reduce the flame to low and slow cook the meat, checking every 2 hours in order to adjust the water and cooking temperature as needed. Due to the fact that regular pots don't seal as the Instant Pot or a slow cooker do, this method requires more water and vigilance.",
            "Sealing The Samosas - My first samosa, despite being well sealed opened up during the frying process. I learned after some experimentation that the best way to insure that this doesn't happen is to press, fold and press again. It doesn't take long and is possibly the most important part of the entire process.",
            "Frying The Samosas - Once your oil is heated to its optimal temperature, in order for the samosas to cook perfectly the oil needs to stay close to that temperature throughout the entire process. This is why I love my chefalarm. It's probe allows it to stay immersed in the oil and I can regulate the heat to make sure the samosas are cooking perfectly. I have learned not to add any more than two samosas to the pre heated oil at a time as adding too many causes the temperature to drop too much. This slows down the frying process, leading to greasy samosas versus crisp ones, as the prolonged immersion in the oil leads to excess oil absorption."

            "Meat - Regular stew meat is perfect for this recipe.",
            "Chana Daal - Chana daal is a lentil variety known most commonly as split Bengal Gram, split chickpea lentils, or yellow split peas. This can be purchased at South Asian stores, on Amazon, and occasionally at Walmart.",
            "Potatoes - Yukon gold or red potatoes are best for this recipe. If you use a russet potato, use half since they are bigger than the other varieties. Mash the potato into a creamy consistency with no lumps. The purpose here is solely to bind the mixture, so you shouldn't see or taste the potato.",
            "Bread - Pulse the bread in a food processor to make crumbs. These crumbs will help absorb excess moisture and act as a binding agent. If you want, you can substitute 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs per slice of bread in the recipe.",
            "Mix-ins - The finer the green onions, chilies, and cilantro are chopped, the better they will mix with the meat mixture. Large pieces can cause the patties to break.",
            "Cooking the kabab mixture- The trick is to ensure the meat is cooked and tender enough for the food processor to shred it to a fine silky texture. Adding 2 cups of water to the meat is more than enough since all the other ingredients will release some juices. Too much liquid can make the mixture soggy and cause the kababs to break. I usually test the meat by poking a knife through a piece of the meat to see if it breaks apart easily. At this point, I uncover the pot and dry out the excess liquid. This is key to the kababs turning out perfect! The final mixture must be completely dry! After sauteeing and drying out any residual water, leave the pot uncovered so the mixture continues to dry as it cools down.",
            "Grinding the mixture - Start by grinding the beef mixture so the lentils, beef, onions, ginger, and garlic are well blended. It's best to do this in batches for perfect consistency. Prepare the breadcrumbs and mash the potatoes next. Mix them into the meat mixture and the eggs, kneading so everything gets well incorporated. The mixture will initially feel a little sticky due to the eggs, but this goes away after 10-15 minutes.",
            "Making the patties - Mix in all your chopped ingredients next and refrigerate the mixture for 10-15 minutes. This will make it easier to shape the patties. I usually make 20-24 patties with this quantity of meat, the final number depending on the size of each kabab."

            "Frying The Kabab - Make sure to preheat the oil well and don't overcrowd the pan. Let each Kabab cook for 1-2 minutes before flipping it over to prevent it from breaking. If your shami kababs are still breaking, dip them in a hand-beaten egg, and then fry them."

Place the chicken skewers on the pan and cook for 10-15 minutes. Make sure to turning the skewers halfway through the cooking process to get an even char on both sides."

As soon as you open your Instant Pot, check the seasoning and adjust it, if needed, as you saute the meat.",

Once it's nicely browned on all sides, add the marinade and cover with foil to seal the pot tightly before placing the lid on top. Cook on medium-high heat for 30 minutes to create steam and then cook on low for an additional 3 1/2 hours.

Once it's nicely browned, transfer it to your slow cooker along with the marinade. Set to cook for 4 hours on the high setting or 8 hours on a low setting. Once cooked, shred the beef with a fork and if needed cook the residual marinade in a saucepan on the stove to reduce it.",
            "Browning The Beef - There are two ways to brown and cook the meat. One method is to sear the entire 3-pound roast and cook it for 2 hours (In the Instant Pot). However, if you want to cut down on the cooking time, a second method is to cut the roast into 4 big pieces, sear them and cook for 1 hour. I don't recommend cutting the beef into smaller pieces as you won't get nice long shreds unless you have large chunks of meat, but there are times when you may need to take this short cut!"

            "Onion - 1 cup is approximately one large onion or two small onions. Meat - I usually get the hind leg of a goat cut up into pieces by my butcher for this curry. This is extremely succulent meat and makes the best curry, in my opinion. Tomatoes - I like to use Roma tomatoes for my curries. Half a cup is usually two medium-sized Romas, depending on the size of the tomatoes. Spice Powders - I tend to eat less salt than most people, so you may feel the need to tweak the amount to suit your personal taste. Similarly, I keep the level of chilies in my recipe medium (based on Pakistani standards). It may seem too spicy to some and not spicy enough for others. If your palate is used to Pakistani food, you will probably want to keep the spices to the recommended amount or more. If you're experimenting with this type of cuisine and aren't used to a lot of heat, you may want to proceed cautiously. Potatoes- My favorite potato to use in this curry is a red potato. The trick is to have aplump potato quarters that hold their shape but are completely cooked through and soft when broken into. After much trial and error, this potato variety allows me to get perfect results every time! Chilis- Since I like spicy food, I often like to use Thai chilies. If you want to take it down a notch, use serrano peppers instead, and for even less heat, you can opt for jalapenos or deseed the chilies to reduce their potency. The Curry- The key thing in this recipe is the consistency of the curry. Not too thick, not too thin, meat falling off the bones, and fully cooked potatoes that are holding their shape. The way to achieve this is to control the temperature, especially near the end, after you add the potatoes to the curry. Once you add the potatoes and the water, cover your pot and bring the curry to a full boil on high heat. Then reduce the heat to medium and cook for about 10 minutes till you can stick a knife through the potato. Uncover the pot, turn the heat on full, and reduce the water until the oil separates and the curry has the desired consistency. Turn the flame off, garnish with cilantro, and immediately remove the curry from the pot to stop the cooking process. This prevents the potatoes from becoming mushy. Final Tip - If you feel your potatoes are cooked through, and your curry needs to thicken more, gently remove them with a slotted spoon and set them aside so they don't become mushy. Continue cooking the curry until you have it as thick as you like, and then gently add the potatoes."

            "Make homemade tomato pulp - I make my own tomato pulp and freeze it to help me save time. It takes 15 minutes to make a large batch and, unlike canned tomatoes, has no preservatives. To make it, quarter the tomatoes, add them to a saucepan with a quarter cup of water, and cook covered for 10 minutes. Uncover the saucepan and mash the tomatoes using a potato masher. Cool completely and store in a half-cup Soupercubes tray in your freezer. Each half-cup-sized cube equals approximately two Roma tomatoes.",

To prevent the ingredients from sticking to the bottom of the pan, occasionally use a few tablespoons of water to deglaze the pan.",

            "Marinate and freeze - The best method to make this recipe is to buy the meat, marinate it, and freeze it in a resealable plastic bag. Defrost the chops the night before you want to grill them, and you're good to go!",
            "Room temperature before grilling - For best results, remove the lamb chops from the refrigerator 30 minutes before you are ready to grill them. This helps the meat cook quickly and more evenly.",
            "Cook to a safe temperature - The lamb chops must be cooked to a minimum of 145 degrees Fahrenheit for safety reasons. I always use my instant-read thermometer from Thermoworks. For more details on cooking temperatures, refer to this food safety chart.",
            "Rest before serving - Always rest the meat for a few minutes after grilling it. This allows the juices to redistribute and settle, making the meat more succulent. If the meat is cut immediately, these juices run out, making the meat taste dry.",
            "Make sure to use a rich marinade - Lamb meat is delicious with a unique flavor but can have a slightly gamey smell depending on where it's been sourced, the age of the animal it came from, and how much fat it has on it. A rich marinade with lots of garlic, like this tandoori spice blend, brings out the best in the meat.",
            "Cook on high heat - Lamb chops that are cut individually cook very quickly. For best results, cook them on high heat. This will ensure a nice char on the outside and juicy meat on the inside."

            "Seasoning - Salt and chilies are spices that often need adjustment to personal taste. I tend to keep them on the lower side in my recipes, as more can always be added, but too much can be a problem. I recommend tasting the curry towards the end of the cooking process and adjusting it to suit your taste. Lemon - One large lemon is approximately equal to 2 teaspoons. Meat - In Pakistan, we get a specific cut of meat called \"undercut\" for pasandas, and the butcher usually trims it and cuts it into perfectly sized pieces. The best I've found here in the USA is tenderloin. If you can access a good butcher who will slice it into thin 2x4 strips, that's perfect! If not, grab a good knife and do the best you can! The thinner the strips, the better! Tenderizing - Even though the strips are cut thin, they must be tenderized. The best way to do that is to use the rough side of a meat mallet to pound them till they're half as thin and double in size. Cooking Time - If the meat is of good quality and has been cut as specified, it should be done in the time stipulated. However, conditions such as the stove you're using, the cooking pot, and the actual meat itself all play a role in the final results. Use your best judgment to decide when the meat is done."

            "Source the right meat - Getting the right meat and having it cut the right way is instrumental to the success of this pasanda recipe. If you go to a Pakistani butcher you can simply tell them you need meat for Pasanda and they'll give you the proper cut, sliced thin. If that isn't an option, go to the meat counter at your local supermarket, ask for tenderloin, and specify how you need the meat sliced.",
            "Marinate overnight - For best results, pound your pasanda filets thin and marinate them overnight. It's also possible to buy the meat, prep it, marinate it, and freeze it till you need it. On the day you want to serve it, simply fry the filets and prepare the curry.",
            "Slow-cook it - This is traditionally a slow-cooked recipe, just like my tandoori beef roast and my roast leg of goat recipes. Although you are welcome to use your Instant Pot or pressure cooker to speed up the process, the flavor of your Pasanda recipe will be best if slow-cooked."

The Rose Petals - These are optional, pistachios alone will do the trick if you can't source these. Silver leaf is also used to decorate Pakistani deserts and is an option. Roasting The Vermicelli - The only tricky part in this entire process is roasting the vermicelli. It must be roasted till it's even brown. The oil must be heated well and the vermicelli must be turned constantly to ensure this. Otherwise, it will burn in spots and the Kheer will have a burnt and smoky taste. The Consistency - The kheer thickens more as it cools down. The trick is to turn the stove off as soon as the spoon is coated with the mixture. As it cools down it will thicken considerably and the end result will be perfect."

            "Onion: My onion was very large, so I used 1. If yours is small, then you may need two. Approximately 2 cups (1 cup per pound of meat) is a good rule to apply.",
            "The onions are the mainstay of a good korma. They provide the consistency, flavor, and color of the dish. Typically, these are sliced thinly in semi-circular slices and sauteed to a nice brown hue. Often strained from the oil, cooled, and crushed, they're added back to the curry later.",
            "All of this takes quite some time, and I found a while ago that grinding them in the food processor helps them cook more quickly and evenly. It also eliminates the need to cool and then crush them. Since then, I've always cooked my Korma this way.",
            "Chicken: Adding all the chicken simultaneously decreases the oil's temperature drastically and affects the cooking process. Korma is based on the \"braised\" cooking technique, which means the meat must first be fried on high heat and then cooked on slow heat. For this reason, we add the chicken a little at a time, fry it till it starts sizzling, which indicates the oil has once again increased in temperature, and then add some more.",
            "Yogurt: Like the chicken, adding all the yogurt at once drastically reduces the cooking temperature and causes the yogurt to curl. For this reason, add in no more than 1/4 cup at a time, let it heat up, and then add 1/4 cup more, and so forth until all of it is incorporated.",
            "The Curry: Once the chicken is cooked, please ensure your curry has the perfect consistency before turning the stove off. If it's too thin, cook it uncovered as long as necessary. If it's too thick, add some water to create the perfect consistency.",
            "Garnish: Adding the six pods of cardamom and the kewra at this stage gives the korma its famous aroma. The entire cardamom is added, but it's crushed lightly to release the essential oils before doing so. Too much Kewra can cause the Korma to taste slightly bitter, so stick strictly to the measurements. Sprinkle the almonds right at the end to prevent them from getting soggy and serve."

Straining the tamarind - When you're straining the tamarind for the juice it has to be clear of all the fiber. I keep a jug of water on hand and use small amounts if necessary to help the process, at times straining the tamarind more than once helps to get the desired results. Adding the water - You can add the 4 cups of water right away and have the juice ready to go OR prepare the concentrate and store it in the fridge, adding the water later. The rim -When you rub the lemon around the rim, slightly tilt the glass at a 45 degree angle to prevent the juice from running down the sides of the glass The garnishing salts -I purchased the habanero cane sugar and sriracha sea salt from spiceandteamerchants.com and decided to rim my glass with a combination of the two.

            "Make a batch of samosas and freeze them - I like to make a large batch of samosas and freeze them. Make the samosas per this recipe and lay them flat on a baking sheet (no overlapping) for perfect results. If they don't fit in one layer, place foil over your first layer and lay the rest out in a second layer until they're all made. Freeze them overnight, then put them in a ziplock freezer bag for easy storage. This method ensures that each samosa is separate. If you have to pull them apart, the wrapper will rip and tear, causing problems during the frying.",
            "Ensure there are no lumps in the potatoes - Since the spring roll wrappers are very thin, any lumps can cause tears. This allows oil to get to the filling and spoils the taste and texture of the samosas. For best results, make sure the potatoes are well mashed.",
            "Ensure the filling is cool before you fill the wrappers - If the potatoes are still hot, the wrapper will become soggy. For a crispy samosa, the potato filling must be at room temperature.",
            "Seal the wrappers tight before frying them - For a perfect samosa, ensure that each samosa is sealed tight and has no gaps.",
            "Prevent the samosas from drying when baking or air frying - Keep some oil and a basting brush on hand if you're not frying the samosas. The wrappers absorb a lot of oil as they cook, so you must brush some oil on them at intervals to prevent them from being too dry."

        "notes": [
            "Lentils - The lentils used in this recipe are known as chana dal, split chickpeas, or split Bengal grams. Soaking these overnight is optional, but it helps reduce flatulence associated with eating lentils and cooks them more quickly. If you're short of time, the recipe can be cooked without the soaking. Potatoes - I used two large Idaho potatoes for this recipe, roughly 2 cups once cooked and mashed. Also known as russet potatoes, these are high in starch and are good for mashing. Ensure there are no lumps in the potatoes to shape your kababs properly. Onions - A half-medium yellow onion cooked with the lentils helps give them flavor and softens them so that the kababs are not too dry or bland. Once ready to eat, the remaining onion can be used as a topping for the final bun kabab. Amchur - A popular seasoning in South Asian cooking made from dried mango. A powder that is slightly tangy in taste, it tastes exceptionally delicious when added to vegetables. This added flavor is much needed in this recipe since both lentils and potatoes are bland. Adding it to the lentil and potato mixture at the end is best to get the most from its flavor. Chaat masala - A unique spice blend with a slightly funky smell, added at the end to the kababs. The taste is tangy, spicy, sour, sweet, and salty. This is a spice blend South Asians add to almost every snack they eat. I suggest adding it to the lentil and potato mixture as you form the patties and sprinkling it on at the end just before serving. I love adding a dash to my bun kabab as a final touch of flavor. Chutneys - I suggest using my recipes for my tamarind dipping sauce and my cilantro mint chutney, but you can use your favorite chutney recipe or buy a store-bought chutney to save time. Buns - I like to use potato buns as they are soft and slightly sweet, like the bun kabab buns I remember enjoying in Pakistan. Once I've fried all the kababs, I discard the excess oil in the pan and heat the buns in the remaining grease. This gives them an authentic street food taste."

            "Salt - I start with 1/2 a teaspoon and add more if needed. It's best to start with a smaller amount and add more as needed.",
            "Green onions - The green onions add color and flavor to the rice. They don't need to be cooked much, so I toss them in at the end.",
            "Frying the rice - The best way to fry the rice is on high heat. Stir constantly and mix everything in well as quickly as you can to prevent the rice from getting mushy."

Sauté for 7-8 minutes, until the onions turn golden brown. Deglaze with 2-3 tbsp of water. Once the water dries up, add the garlic and ginger and sauté for another 2 minutes, until aromatic and the onions deepen even more in color.

Add the green chili peppers, heavy cream, butter, and fenugreek leaves. Stir gently to combine.",

            "Note 1: To Cook Dried Red Kidney Beans\nSoak dried kidney beans in water overnight, or at least 6 hours.\nTo cook on the stovetop: Drain kidney beans and add them to a pot along with 6 cups of water. Cover to bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium so that it remains at a simmer. Cover with the lid ajar, and allow to cook for 1hr and 15 minutes, or until the beans break easily when pressed between your fingers. If you haven’t pre-soaked, you’ll need to add more water and cook longer (~2+ hrs). Here are more tips from The Kitchn for cooking beans on the stovetop.\nTo cook in the Instant Pot or electric pressure cooker: Drain kidney beans and add them to the Instant Pot along with 3 cups water. Cook on high pressure for 30 minutes (beans setting). NPR. The beans should break easily when pressed between your fingers. If you have not pre-soaked, you’ll need to add more water and cook longer (~4 cups water, 45 min).\nDrain (if you’d like), reserving the cooking liquid: See Note 2.",
            "Note 2: Reserved Rajma Cooking Liquid. (Ignore if using canned kidney beans).\nYou can drain the cooked dried beans, reserving their cooking water, to make them easier to mash or to measure if you have enough liquid. However, this isn’t necessary and you can simply add the cooking water along with the beans.\nThe amount of water used to cook the dried beans typically leaves ~2 cups of cooking liquid, which is perfect for this recipe. That said, you don’t need exactly 2 cups – more or less is fine. You can easily adjust the consistency by either simmering to reduce the liquid or adding more water as needed.",
            "Note 3: If you’ve used dried beans, the Rajma doesn’t demand the cream. But I tend to add it anyway. You want just enough so that it doesn’t mask the other flavors. Sub half and half or coconut milk to keep it dairy-free.",
            "Helpful Measurements:\n1 cup (~180g) dried kidney beans yield anywhere from 370-450g cooked beans.\n2 (15-oz) cans OR 1 (27-oz) can yields ~490g cooked beans."

            "The green chili peppers are added at the end, which means they must be comfortably hot. If your green chili peppers are too hot to bite into, remove the seeds, chop it into smaller pieces, and only use half.",
            "To double the recipe on the stovetop, use 3 1/3 cups water to cook the dal instead of 3 1/2 cups, which would be double the amount of water. Whenever you’re doubling a recipe, you want to minimize excess liquid."

As per original recipe, you may also pulse to shred 7-8 times in the food processor – but be careful about breaking the grains too much and losing the strands of meat.)",
            "Use an immersion blender to blend the dal until smooth. (Alternatively, transfer to your food processor to process until smooth.) Turn on the Instant Pot to Sauté mode and set to Less/Low.",
            "Add the shredded beef and rolled oats and stir. Sauté for 3-5 minutes to cook this mixture down. Once the haleem starts bubbling, cancel Sauté and cover with a lid.",
            "Select Slow Cook and set to More/High. Allow to cook, stirring occasionally, for an additional 20-30 minutes (See Note 1). Use a wooden spoon to crush the remaining beef and lentils on the side of the pan. Your haleem is done once you've reached a 'laced' consistency. (See Note 2) If the haleem thickens too much, add 1/2-1 cup boiling water and continue to stir. Add the garam masala/chaat masala and black pepper and stir to mix.",

            "In a medium skillet, heat ghee or oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and sauté, stirring occasionally, until golden brown (~5-6 min). Stir more cautiously toward the end because you want them deep brown in color but not burnt.",
            "Pour the tadka over the haleem. Garnish and serve with more garnishing on the side."
        ],
        "notes": [
            "Note 1: I like to go back and forth between Sauté – Less and Slow Cook – More. If using Sauté – Less, stir constantly to prevent bubbling. If you have the time, I suggest letting it Slow cook – More even longer, up to 4 hours. Add water to thin out as necessary. Lastly, if you have the new Instant Pot model, feel free to transfer the pot itself to the stove. Cook over low heat instead of the ‘Slow Cook’ setting to reach the laced consistency.",
            "Note 2: If you lift your spoon and drop the haleem, it shouldn’t drop like a soup or curry, but like a thick batter or paste with the shreds of the haleem lingering from the spoon.",
            "Note 3: Update Jul 16, 2024 – Many readers suggested adding pearl barley, so I tested and added to the recipe as an optional ingredient, showing how and where it’d be used. It adds texture & creaminess which is always great in haleem, and you can increase the quantity if you’d like. I also made slight improvements to the recipe. For example, the updated recipe gives the option to use potato masher to shred the beef instead of pulsing it in the food processor, which carries the risk of shredding too much. Please note that if adding barley, the recipe is no longer gluten-free.",
            "Note 4: The meat should break easily when pressed with a wooden spoon. If it doesn’t, cover and pressure cook again for another 5-10 minutes."

Layer the lid with a kitchen cloth (or aluminum foil) and seal tightly. The goal is to keep as much of the steam inside as possible. Turn on the heat to medium and allow the biryani to develop steam for 4-5 minutes. You’ll be able to feel the steam starting to escape the sides. Then turn down to the lowest heat and allow it to cook in its steam (‘dum’) for 20 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the biryani to rest with the lid on for 10 minutes. Do not stir or mix. To serve, gently move on to platter with rice paddle or small plate. Serve hot with yogurt or raita."

            "Note 4:\nAir-frying Instructions\nFor best results, consider frying. Air-frying makes the chicken extra crispy but it’s juicier, more moist, when fried. Now that I’ve given the disclaimer, here’s how to air-fry:\nTip: Since the air fryer doesn’t cook the coating as effectively as frying, use 1/3 cup of cornstarch instead of 1/2 cup to minimize the amount of dry flour.\n\nPreheat air fryer at 400°F (190°C) for 5 minutes. Lightly spray the bottom of the air fryer basket with cooking spray.\nPlace the chicken pieces in a single layer so they’re not touching. (I need to do 3 batches in my air-fryer.)\nSpray the top of the chicken generously with cooking spray.\nAir fry the chicken pieces at 400°F (190°C) for 8-9 minutes, or until they’re lightly golden brown. If you want, you can flip the pieces/give it a shake midway for more even cooking, but I don’t bother."

Add the egg white, garlic, soy sauce, white pepper, black pepper, salt, baking soda, and sesame oil and toss to coat the chicken evenly. Cover and allow to marinate for at least 30 minutes, up to 24 hours in the fridge (the longer the better!). When you’re ready to cook, add the cornstarch and all-purpose flour and toss to coat the chicken. It’ll form an uneven, scraggly edged coating.",
            "Preheat oil: Heat a large frying pan or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add oil so that it’s at least 1/2”/1.27 cm deep. It should be deep enough so that the batter doesn't stick to the bottom. Once the oil is hot, adjust heat level as needed to maintain medium-high heat (around 325-350°F/113-175°C).",
            "Fry chicken: One at a time, lift each chicken piece and gently place it into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry, turning occasionally, until golden and crispy, about 4 minutes.",
            "Remove: Use a slotted spoon or spider strainer to remove from oil and transfer to a paper-towel lined plate or wire cooling rack. Repeat with the remaining chicken.",
            "Prep Sauce: In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together all the ingredients listed under ‘Honey Sauce’.",
            "Reduce Sauce: Pour the sauce into a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook, stirring or whisking occasionally, for 5-6 minutes. The sauce will go from thick to thin as it heats up, before becoming thick again. It should develop a honey-like consistency, so that it’s no longer runny and coats the back of a spoon without easily dripping off. Turn off heat and set aside.",
            "Stir-fry: Heat a wok or large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the oil, onions, bell pepper, and julienned ginger and toss, breaking up the onions. Spread the vegetables evenly in the pan and allow them to cook, undisturbed, for 1-2 minutes, until lightly browned around the edges. Continue to cook for another minute.",
            "Toss: Stir in the reduced sauce, then add the fried chicken. Toss everything together, ensuring the chicken is fully coated with the sauce. Top with sesame seeds, if using. Serve with white jasmine rice or plain basmati rice."

            "Note 3: No-Fry options – Pan-frying results are amazing. So tender yet crunchy. Air-frying won’t give the same results but if that’s what’ll get you to try this recipe, give it a go!",
            "Note: Since pan-frying or air-frying doesn’t cook the coating as effectively as frying, use 1/3 cup of cornstarch instead of 1/2 cup to minimize the amount of excess dry flour."

Preheat air fryer at 400°F (190°C) for 5 minutes. Lightly spray the bottom of the air fryer basket with cooking spray. 2. Place the chicken pieces in a single layer so they’re not touching. (I need to do 3 batches in my air-fryer.) 3. Spray the top of the chicken generously with cooking spray, making sure to get dry spots of flour. 4.

Here’s how to do it: In a medium bowl, combine the chicken breast with all the spices and 1/2 tsp salt along with 2 tbsp of yogurt. Set aside. When it calls for it in the recipe, add the chicken along with the remaining 1/2 + 1/8 tsp salt."

(i.e. Turbinado sugar is less sweet than regular.) The amount given is on the lower end of sweetness. If you want it sweeter, you can always add 1 to 2 1/2 tbsp after adding the sugar syrup to the sooji."

            "The Yogurt -I use full fat yogurt as it makes the chicken creamier. The Cooking Oil -Use any neutral cooking oil, such as avocado, canola, sunflower or peanut that can tolerate high heat. The Chili Powder - I use 2 teaspoons of red chilli powder as I like things a little on the spicier side. feel free to adjust the spices to your personal taste. The Red Food Coloring - This is purely optional but if  you want your chicken tikka to look like what you eat at a restaurant then you may need a few drops of the food coloring. A healthier alternative is red beetroot powder. The Bread - My supermarket has what they call steak rolls, which are similar in texture to crusty french bread. These are my favorite but feel free to switch it up. The Cheese - I like to use mozzarella, but any cheese will do. Provolone or smoked gouda would be good options to consider. Marinating the chicken -  30 minutes is a minimum, but I often leave my chicken in the fridge overnight or marinate it and freeze it for when I need it. A longer marinade will make your chicken more tender."

            "I use a cut up Raan (goat meat from the hind legs) for this recipe as it's very soft and succulent meat. If you're not a fan of goat meat you can use chicken,veal or beef  instead. The oil may seem like a lot but is essential to good biryani as they help keep the rice grains separate. Sella rice is ideal for biryani as it adds to the aroma and the grains are long and tend to stay seperate. The rice must be well salted in order for the flavor of the dish to come through. I tend to prefer a little less salt than most people so please adjust the quantity as needed. Dry roasting and grinding the spices yourself will make your biryani smell exquisite. Roast each spice separately for best results as different ones have a different burn point. But if you don't have time for this step then I would suggest Shan Bombay Biryani Masala (1 packet for this quantity of meat and rice). Marinating the meat makes sure that it's well seasoned all the way through. After 2 hours, take the meat out of the fridge. By the time you're done prepping the rest of the ingredients it will be a at room temperature and cook more evenly. The consistency of the Korma gravy has to be perfect, not too dry and not too liquidy. Cooking the tomatoes first and mashing them helps reach that consistency more quickly and effectively. Soaking the potatoes in the water keeps them from browning till you're ready to add them to the curry. It's best to add the meat in small batches as adding it all at once drops the temperature of the oil and onions and stops it from browning properly. The potatoes will continue cooking after you turn the stove off and also during the steaming part later. If you overcook them at this point they will break apart. The soaking time has been given with Sella Rice in mind. If you're using traditional Basmati Rice then don't soak for more than an hour. A lot of water is needed as the rice expands during the soaking, start with at least 3 times the water and check periodically incase the rice has absorbed too much water and you need to add more. There needs to be at least 30% more water than rice for it to cook properly and the water needs to be well salted or the rice will taste bland later. The oil is added to help keep the grains separated and is a must. Everyone has a different stove and cooking utensils so a way to test if the rice is 80% cooked is to take a grain and squeeze it between your thumb and forefinger. If it breaks into exactly two pieces it's ready to be strained. Soak the saffron in the milk and set aside in the fridge when you start boiling the water for the rice so it has time to release it's flavor and color. Make sure the korma is hot before you add it as this will help create the steam which is essential at this point. Turn your flame as low as it will go to prevent the gravy from burning and sticking to the pot. When you dish the Biryani out spread it in a manner that the colored layers of rice and korma mix a little bit so you get all the flavors in each bite."

            "Rice to Meat Ratio - Biryani is perfect only when every spoonful has meat and rice in it. To ensure that, the ideal ratio is 1 pound of meat per 1 pound of rice (1 pound of rice is 2 cups). My recipe has this perfect ratio, thus the title Best Mutton Biryani Recipe. If I chose to add potatoes, I would usually add 1-2 potatoes for this much rice and meat, depending on the size of the potatoes.",
            "Spices in The Rice- Biryani is meant to be a spicy dish and since the korma is cooked separately and layered with plain boiled rice, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to infuse that rice with some spices. This is why The Best Mutton Biryani Recipe has a spice pouch added to the rice. Many people simply toss the spices in but I prefer not to do that as having to pick them out or accidentally biting into them ruins the Biryani experience for me! Add them however you please but definitely do add them!",
            "Calculating How Much to Cook Per Person - When planning how much to cook I usually estimate about \u00e2\u2026\u201c cup of rice per person when I have other items on my menu and 1/2 cup per person if the Biryani is going to be my only entr\u00c3\u00a9e. I then calculate how much meat I need based on the meat to rice ratio above. Of course, a lot depends on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appetites and whether or not you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re adding potatoes. Typically,  I would cook 1 pound of meat and 2 cups of rice for 6 people. If I add potatoes then It may stretch to feed about 8 people.",
            "Cook the Korma Ahead of Time - Cooking Biryani is complicated partially because there are many components to it. I often cook my Korma a day ahead of time to save some time, especially if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m cooking for a large number of people. On the day I plan to serve the Biryani I reheat the meat curry and add the potatoes to cook at that time. While the potatoes are cooking, I prepare the rice and then layer, steam (dum) and serve!",
            "Fixing Undercooked or Overcooked Rice - To this day, despite years of cooking experience, I often over cook or undercook my rice. Worry not, there are easy ways to salvage the rice in either situation.",
            "Undercooked Rice - If your rice is undercooked, add a little extra water (about \u00c2\u00bd cup for the quantity in this recipe) when you set the Biryani to steam. This will create more steam than normal and help cook the rice through. Then add 5 extra minutes to the time that you steam the rice. To prevent the korma at bottom from burning, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t extend the steaming time beyond 5 minutes but leave the pot covered with the foil and the lid on for an extra 10 minutes after you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve turned the stove off.",
            "Overcooked Rice - For overcooked rice, lay the rice out in a thin layer in a large foil tray or other container and let the steam evaporate. This helps dry the rice out. When in doubt about cooking times, remember that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easier to fix undercooked rice versus overcooked rice.",
            "Adjusting the salt in the Rice - I would always caution you to add less salt and fix your Biryani later versus accidentally adding too much. However, If you have added excess salt make some raita and kachumber salad and either leave the salt out or halve the quantity. When the Biryani is eaten with the Raita the saltiness will be less prominent. If you have added too little, mix some salt with a small amount of water and drizzle on the Biryani when you steam it. This should fix it!"

Once you add the cornstarch slurry, and depending on whether or not you're adding soy sauce to the soup, you'll need to adjust the seasoning to taste. Cooking time - This soup will take even less time, about 15 minutes, to assemble if you use store-bought broth and rotisserie chicken. Canned Corn - If you want to use creamed corn, you can use canned or make your own by running the corn through a blender (one or two pulses should be enough). About 1/2 a cup will be sufficient. This will make the soup thick, and depending on what consistency you like, you may need to adjust the amount of cornstarch you use."

Let the turkey cook for at least an hour, as opening the oven repeatedly causes the temperature to drop. Then baste the skin with the drippings at 30 minute intervals, to prevent it from drying out."

Smaller turkeys are easier to cook, so if you're feeding a large crowd, I suggest getting two 10 lb turkeys instead of one large 20 lb one. Download the free cooking chart above if you don't want to do all the math.",
            "Cooking time-The cooking time for a turkey is calculated at 15 minutes a pound, but many variables need to be accounted for. Factors like your personal kitchen equipment and whether or not the turkey is stuffed may require you to adjust the time provided. For this reason, I suggest using a thermometer like the Thermapen for absolute accuracy.",
            "Let the turkey sit after roasting - This is the key to a juicy tandoori turkey. If you carve the turkey immediately, the juices will run out, leaving the turkey dry.",
            "Don't skimp on the fat-Let's face it, you probably only eat a turkey roast once or, at most, twice a year. Don't stress over the amount of oil and butter this recipe calls for; stick to the recommended amount.",
            "Don't overcook the turkey-This is the most common mistake people make. The ideal temperature reading for a fully cooked turkey is 165 degrees Fahrenheit, which means that you need to take it out when it reaches 160 degrees. It will continue to cook while resting and be at the perfect temperature when you're ready to carve it."

I usually start watching the naan closely at 3 minutes to ensure they don't overcook, which can make them hard and chewy. Remove the naan at the first sign of brown spots on the surface. If you've cooked for 5 minutes and still don't see any brown spots, broil for 15-30 seconds rather than cooking them longer.",
            "Stuffing the naan-Overstuffing the naan can create holes when you roll it out. This will cause the stuffing to fall out, so roll it out just until you have a well-shaped naan with the stuffing intact.",
            "Remember to prick the naan - Pricking the naan is essential for that perfect texture. If this is not done correctly, the naan will puff up, and you will have a pocket like pita bread."

The seasoning will cause the tomatoes to release water, making it difficult for the batter to adhere to them. Tossing them in some corn flour helps counter this. Frying them - For best results, Preheat the oil well and keep it at 350 degrees Fahrenheit throughout frying. This ensures crispy pakoras that are cooked through in the center.",

Oven - Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and bake the fish in a roasting pan with a rack. Cook for 20 minutes, flipping the fish over halfway through. Check for doneness using a thermometer. Airfry - For this method, preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and cook the fish for 10 minutes, flipping halfway through and checking with a thermometer at the end.",

            "Alternate cooking methods - Don't want to or can't use a grill? Check out these alternative methods: Air fryer - This is my preferred cooking method when grilling isn't an option. I use an Air fryer oven that I have had for years and love. It allows me to cook fairly large quantities in one go, which is ideal for my family. Set the air fryer at 400 degrees Fahrenheit and preheat for 5 minutes. Cook the chicken for 15 minutes, flipping the skewers halfway through. Stovetop - If I use a stovetop for the chicken, I cook it in a  Grill Pan. This helps give it a little char and some sear marks. Oven - This is my least favorite method because it's hard to get a good char on the chicken, but if this is the most convenient method for you, then by all means, opt for it. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and bake for 20 minutes, followed by a 2-minute broil on each side to give it some color."

            "Marinating - The ground beef should marinate for at least 30 minutes, but ideally, overnight.",
            "Cooking - The keema will initially be clumped together. As the heat gets to it, it will release water. Break it up with a cooking spoon for an even consistency, and roast it for at least 10 minutes after all the water evaporates.",
            "Smoking - This is key to a perfect dum ka keema. The coal must be well-lit to smoke properly when doused in oil. Cover the pot with a tight lid when the coal starts to smoke. Smoke the meat for a minimum of 10 minutes for the perfect taste."

            "Ginger & Garlic Paste - I prepare and freeze my ginger and garlic paste in a large batch and freeze it to use as needed. If I don't have any in my freezer, I use my mortar and pestle or a garlic press and grater to quickly paste a 1.5-inch piece of ginger and 20 garlic cloves. Of course, store-bought paste is always an option.",
            "Marinating the chicken - Marinating it for a minimum of 30 minutes is sufficient for tenderizing it, but this step can also be done a day before. This will help you get dinner on the table faster the following day.",
            "Grilling the chicken - If the weather permits, grilling the chicken on an outdoor grill is a great option and gives the most authentic flavor. A grill pan is my favorite method when cooking indoors, as it gives the chicken a nice char. However, baking and air-frying the chicken are both options, depending on your preference. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and bake the chicken for 20 minutes before adding it to the masala. For the air fryer, cook the chicken at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes.",
            "Roasting the Tikka Masala - This step, known as 'bhunna' in Pakistani cooking lingo, is important for several reasons. It adds to the ingredients' flavor while helping to mash and blend them together. This ensures that the final masala or curry will be the perfect consistency. The rule is to keep roasting till you see oil separating from the blended masala. In this instant, there's very little oil so it doesn't really separate. However, your mixture will roll into a ball in the center of the pan, indicating that all the ingredients are well blended and you're ready for the next step."

            "Cook the chicken using an alternate method - Baking, air frying, grilling, and using a stovetop grill pan are all good options. Grilling the chicken outdoors on a grill is definitely the best option, but the grill pan yields the best results of all the indoor methods and is convenient. Baking and air frying are great options in a rush, as they require much less effort. For baking, cook at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes and add the chicken to the masala straight after. For Air frying, cook for 10 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and then add it to the curry."

            "THE RICE -",
            "Which rice: For this recipe, use Sela rice. This special rice is parboiled in the husk, so each grain stays fluffy and separate. I always use it for my special rice recipe.",
            "Soaking it: Sela rice has to be soaked for at least 2 hours for best results. I usually like to soak it for 4 hours if I have the time.",
            "Cooking it: If you've soaked it for 2 hours, cook the rice to 95%. If you've soaked it for 4 hours, then 90% is sufficient.",
            "Let the boiled rice cool and all excess water evaporate while you saute the cardamom and cloves. This will prevent it from getting mushy.",
            "Steaming it: Ensure it doesn't burn at the bottom when steaming the rice. I have a gas stove, so I have much control over the heat. If your lowest setting seems too high, place a 'tawa' (flat skillet) on the stove and the cooking pot on the skillet so the heat is indirect.",
            "The foil ensures a tight seal and keeps all the steam in, so wrap this well and place the lid firmly on top. Place a heavy object on the lid to weigh it down and help keep the steam inside the pot if you'd like. This is an ancient technique that helps the rice fluff up better.",
            "After 20 minutes, carefully uncover the lid and foil, gently fluff the rice, and serve.",
            "Yellow food coloring - If you add saffron, it adds a yellow color to the rice. However, too much can be overpowering in taste. For this reason, a little food coloring is usually added to Zarda, whether saffron is being used or not.",
            "Cooking oil - I use avocado or canola oil for my Zarda if I make it for a quick dessert just for my family because we're craving it. If it's a special occasion, I use ghee as the nutty taste is delicious. Any high heat index oil like peanut or sunflower works just as well as canola, and butter can be used instead of ghee to provide a richer taste.",
            "The cardamom - To break open a pod, use a mortar and pestle. If you don't have one, you can use a rolling pin, the back of a spoon, or the flat end of a knife to apply gentle pressure. For this recipe, as soon as the pod cracks open, you can saute it.",
            "Saffron - When slow-cooking a wet dish, or as in this case, steaming the rice for an extended period, blooming the saffron before adding it in is unnecessary. I add the threads directly to the milk, pour, and steam. When the rice is ready, the saffron threads are fully dissolved, and the saffron is nice and fragrant.",
            "Milk - Adding milk rather than water makes the zarda rich and creamy. Too much can make the rice mushy, so a small amount is enough."

            "Meat - I use a cut-up, bone-in goat leg for best results. I find the lean and succulent meat perfect for this recipe. If you prefer a slightly fattier cut, a goat shoulder works well.",
            "Rice - Long-grain aged basmati rice is a must for a perfect pulao. I use a variety called Sela basmati rice, which is known for all of the above and has a higher nutritional value than regular.",
            "Oil - Traditionally, South Asian cooking is prepared with the use of Ghee. I use canola or avocado oil on a regular basis and save Ghee for special occasions and a more authentic flavor. You can choose either option or use 1/2 oil and 1/2 ghee for a happy medium.",
            "Onions - Properly caramelized onions create the base for this recipe and are the main source of flavor for any pilaf. All the other ingredients are added to and layered with these onions to create the taste that pulao is famous for. I use two onions per cup of rice for all my pulao recipes.",
            "Garlic/Ginger Paste - Please take the time to use freshly prepared garlic and ginger paste if possible. It's so easy with the use of a Mortar and Pestle and will considerably improve the flavor of your pulao. Add 20 cloves of garlic and a 2-inch piece of peeled and sliced ginger to your mortar and pestle for the two tablespoons needed for this recipe.",
            "Coriander Powder - I add this to my meat and onions as I saute them at the last stage to add color and flavor to my pulao.",
            "Salt - The right quantity of salt is very important, so while four teaspoons may sound like a lot, the starch in the rice will pull all that flavor and needs it to taste delicious.",
            "The aromatics - Separating the whole spices into groups and adding them at different intervals allows for a depth of aroma that would be otherwise missing. You'll note that the scent of spices added to any food diminishes with time as it cooks. Thus, adding the spices at intervals during the cooking process allows for a stronger aroma throughout the finished dish."

A beef rice pilaf will take longer, and the meat will be a little tougher than mutton or chicken, but it's a good option if you're not a fan of goat meat.",

            "Top with fried onions - Try a popular variation of mutton pulao and top your plated mutton yakhni pulao with crispy fried onions known as birista.",
            "Try Ghee - Try cooking the rice pilaf with Ghee, or use 1/2 ghee and 1/2 cooking oil.",
            "Add tomatoes - Try a variation of this mutton recipe with tomatoes. Simply add two diced tomatoes to the meat when you saute it after the stock is ready.",
            "Add yogurt - My recipe doesn't have yogurt, but you can try adding 1 cup to your pilaf for a Kashmiri yakhni pulao version. Add it in, like the tomatoes mentioned above, when you're sauteeing the meat for the last time before adding in the water and rice."
        ],
        "expert_tips": [
            "Add rib pieces to your stock - My mother always purchased an entire goat and used the various cuts for different recipes. She always separated the small bony rib pieces with very little meat for her pulao yakhni. The bones add tons of flavor, and if you can access some and add them to your broth, you'll see a difference in flavor.",
            "Use Sela Rice - My go-to is zebra-basmati-rice-parboiled-extra-long-grain. Parboiled rice, known as Sela rice, is partially cooked while still inside the husk. This method helps preserve its nutrients and also makes it less sticky. It is ideal for and the most widely used rice for making pulao and biryani.",
            "Don't skimp on the oil or the salt - A good pilaf needs just the right amount of oil and salt. You should be able to see a little bit of oil floating on the surface of your broth, and it should taste almost too salty. The final result will be perfectly salted and separate grains of rice.",
            "Use the right pot to cook your pulao - Use a wide, shallow pot for best results. This facilitates the evaporation of water and allows the rice enough room to expand so it won't get soggy.",
            "Don't stir the rice while cooking - I stir it only once after adding it to the stock. Too much stirring will cause the rice kernels to break and ruin the final finish of your pulao."

            "Yogurt - Plain full-fat yogurt is always my recommendation for cooking. It helps make the gravy/masala thick and creamy and adds moisture to the meat so it stays moist and juicy.",
            "Tomato Paste - I usually get a small six oz. Can, which is exactly 3/4 of a cup. Make sure to use paste, not plain canned tomatoes, as the flavor and consistency are very different. Tomato paste is more acidic and intense in taste; plus, since it's very dense, it will help thicken the marinade.",
            "Goat Leg Size - 2 - 2.5 pounds is my recommendation regarding the size of your leg. This isn't always possible, but try to stay as close to this as you can. The smaller the leg of goat, the more tender it will be.",
            "Dry Roasting The Spices - Dry roasting the spices before grinding them helps them \"bloom\" by releasing their essential oils. This adds to the flavor of whatever you're cooking.",
            "Making cuts in the meat - Making a few deep cuts with your knife helps the marinade get to all the meat and not just stay on the surface. This is essential anytime you cook a large chunk of meat.",
            "Steam Method Of Cooking -  Slow cooking using steam in a tightly sealed container is an ancient method called \"Dum Pukht.\" This seals in all the meat juices and produces tender and flavorful meat. In ancient times, cooking utensils were sealed with a strip of kneaded dough. Today, tightly wrapped foil works great and is my go-to for anything I steam on the stovetop.",
            "Cooking The Raan Uncovered - Once the steam breaks down the collagen, it's time to dry the excess liquid and get a nice thick gravy that will coat the entire leg of goat. Cooking the meat uncovered on medium-high helps achieve this.",
            "Cooking The Potatoes - Peeled and quartered potatoes are cooked in the remaining gravy near the end of the cooking process. Since potatoes need very little cooking time and we want them to retain their shape, I add them to the pot during the last 30 minutes of cooking. If they're done after 15/20 minutes, I just fish them out and set them aside till the meat and gravy are ready."

            "Different marinades - There are many ways to marinate your leg of goat. If you prefer a simpler, less spicy roast, use lemon as a tenderizer and add some salt and pepper for a light seasoning.

Switch things up and experiment with some new combinations to find your favorite.",

The younger and smaller in weight the animal, the more tender the meat. So I try and get a whole leg of goat that is as close to 2.5 pounds as necessary.",
            "Cooking The Potatoes - Cook the potatoes in the marinade to absorb all that flavor from the yogurt and spices. Once the potatoes are cooked through, remove them from the pot and continue to thicken the remaining liquid. I use this as a thick gravy to drizzle on the mutton leg roast and potatoes to prevent the roast from drying once they're plated and served.",
            "Cooking the meat on the stovetop- For best results, use the dum pukht (braising) technique to cook the meat. Sear the leg of mutton on high heat and then slow cook it in its juices, combined with some water and the marinade. For best results, cook the leg until it is fork-tender, usually about 160-165 degrees Fahrenheit internal temperature if checked with a cooking thermometer.",
            "How to fit the goat raan in your cooking pot - To make your roast fit in a cooking pot, ask your butcher to cut the leg bone slightly so you can fold it. You definitely want to add the bone to your pot for flavor, so don't discard it.",
            "Roasting the leg of goat in the oven - Place the leg fat side up in your roasting pan if you're using an oven. As the fat melts and drips down, it will keep the meat juicy."

Yes, it does shave off 20 minutes, but the results aren't as good. The reason is that the best pot for cooking rice is wide, shallow, and heavy-bottomed. The Instant Pot is the exact opposite. It's tall, deep, and light at the bottom. This makes the rice clump together, so you don't get that perfect fluffy, long, long-grained texture that Basmati is famous for."

As the kulfi starts to solidify, stir it every 2 hours to help disburse the nuts evenly. This stirring helps freeze the kulfi faster and reduces any ice crystals, resulting in a creamy mango kulfi.",
